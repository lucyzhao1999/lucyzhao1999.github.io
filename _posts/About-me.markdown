<img src="/images/fulls/03.jpg" class="fit image"> I am a third-year undergraduate student at UCLA with majors in Statistics and Cognitive Science and a minor in Mathematics. My interests lie at the intersection between the study of human mind and mathematical modeling. In particular, I am interested in modeling human social perception and cognition using computing algorithms, which would allow us to understand human social mind on both a computational and an algorithmic level. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, photography and sometimes Vlogging.
